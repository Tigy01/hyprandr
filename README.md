# Hyprandr
An easy to use TUI for managing your monitors' resolutions in Hyprland

## Installation
To install, clone the repo using git and build it with go. 

```
go mod tidy && go get && go build && go install
```

You may need to run go get and/or go mod tidy before building.

## Setup
Upon running the program once, a default display.conf file will be generated
in the ~/.config/hypr/ directory. 

Remove any lines declaring monitors from your hyprland.conf file OR override 
the autogenerated ones found in the displays.conf file with the old ones.

Finally source the displays.conf file in your hyprland.conf file with the 
following line.

```
source = $HOME/.config/hypr/displays.conf
```
## CLI Commands
The tool comes with an integrated cli which can be accessed by running hyprandr -cmd.

The commands for it are the following:
> **-list**, used to list all avaliable resolutions

> **-monitor**, used to specify the monitor to be affected

> **-refresh**, used to refresh the list of avaliable resolutions for change-res

> **-change-res**, used to select a resolution from the list of resolutions
